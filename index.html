                travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone 
                with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management 
                gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
