# Horiseon


This is the Horiseon marketing brochure produced to assist marketing efforts of the organization.

As the brochure has already been created the task at hand is to clean up the code making it easier to read and ensuring that alt tags are in place allowing us to adheir to accessability requirements.

Our process in this code review was to look at each block of code from top to bottom, identify areas of improvement and implement those changes to the html.  Where applicable, updates to the css were made to reflect changes that were made to the html tags impacted.




### **Remaining Changes to be Made**

1. Better alt text is required



### **Changes Made**

1. Alt tags were added to all images except for the main image as it is a background image.

2. Semantic tag headers were added as follows:
    - header
    - nav
    - sections
    - aside
    - footer

3. Removed close img tag from the last image in the aside code as it is not required.
